# Image-Slider-Constructor

The purpose of this constructor is to take an array and an element id (String) and construct an image slider that has all of its elements contained in one object instance with all methods and count variable isolated from outside manipulation. This way there are no outside variables to worry about related to that array and cleans up the code through encapsulation. The removeCurrent() function has been designed to allow for proper functioning without blanking when deleting elements and refers to whichever image still exists in the array that the object refers to.
